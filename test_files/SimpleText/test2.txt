Your README should be a plain text file (openable in nano, for example) containing the name and
net ID of both partners.
Your README may include any design notes or special cases your code can or cannot handle
correctly.
Your README should also describe your testing strategy. What sorts of cases did you create?
Why those cases and not others? What specific aspects of your program do your tests check?
Use of Markdown or similar text formatting conventions is permitted.
